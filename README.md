Career Counseling Program
A simple C program that helps students determine potential career paths based on their interests and backgrounds. The program asks a series of questions and provides suggestions for careers in fields such as medical, engineering, and computer sciences.

Project Overview:

This project was developed to practice and implement fundamental C programming concepts, including:

Structures and Functions
Conditional Statements
Loops
Switch Cases
The program offers tailored career paths by evaluating user responses and suggesting potential universities based on budget preferences.

Features:

Career Path Suggestions: Based on user responses, the program suggests careers in engineering, medical, or computer science fields.
University Recommendations: Suggests universities based on fee range and career path.
User Feedback: Collects feedback to improve the program.       

How It Works:

Users answer questions by ranking from 1 to 5 or responding with "Y/N".
Based on responses, the program suggests career fields such as:
Engineering (Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Software)
Medical (MBBS, BDS, Pharmacy)
Computer Science (AI, Cybersecurity)
The program suggests relevant universities based on fee ranges provided by the user.
Future Enhancements
Add graphical user interface (GUI) for better interaction.
Expand question sets for more career options.
Integrate external career databases for updated suggestions.

Notes:

This project is for educational purposes to strengthen C programming skills.
